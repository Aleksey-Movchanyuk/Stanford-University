Aleksey from Ukraine

Hi All,

I'm Aleksey, I'm from Ukraine, but now I'm living in Poland.

I've been working for many years in Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence field as Architect/Consultant/Trainer.

Last year I have successfully completed the «Data Science Specialization» from «John Hopkins University» on Coursera.

My goals for this course are to be able to understand use cases scenarios for ML and to be able to use ML algorithms in practice.
